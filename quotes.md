Like me he says he's going to be — that little chap who follows me… He knows that I am big and fine — And believes in every word of mine. The base in me he must not see — that little chap who follows me… But after all it's easier, that brighter road to climb, With little hands behind me — to push me all the time. And I reckon I'm a better man than what I used to be… Because I have this lad at home who thinks the world of me.

Laws are like cobwebs which may catch small flies, but let wasps and hornets break through. - Jonathan Swift, satirist (30 Nov 1667-1745)
"If only the sun-drenched celebrities are being noticed and worshiped, then our children are going to have a tough time seeing the value in the shadows, where the thinkers, probers, and scientists are keeping society together." - Rita Dove, poet (b. 28 Aug 1952)
"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum -- even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate." - Noam Chomsky, linguistics professor and political activist (b. 7 Dec 1928)

## Modesty / Humbleness

"Possessions are generally diminished by possession." - Friedrich Nietzsche
"We are brainwashed by our economic system until we end up in a tomb beneath a pyramid of time payments, mortgages, preposterous gadgetry, playthings that divert our attention from the sheer idiocy of the charade. The years thunder by. The dreams of youth grow dim where they lie caked in dust on the shelves of patience. Before we know it, the tomb is sealed." - Sterling Hayden, actor, author, and WWII veteran (26 Mar 1916-1986)
